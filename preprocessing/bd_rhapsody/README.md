# RNA-velocity on BD-Rhapsody data

Usually, BD data is processed using a proprietary pipeline on the sevenbridges platform.
To my knowlege, it currently does not support RNA-velocity analysis.

STARsolo, Kallito/bustools and Alevin all support RNA-velocity out-of-the box.
The most promising report of having applied one of these tools to BD data is
